# Kickstarter Analysis in Excel

## Overview of Kickstarter Analysis

A detailed analysis for theater outcomes based on launch date and an analysis on play outcomes based on goals. 

### Purpose

Find more information for Louise based on launch date and funding goals in order to get a real data set of campaigns and how they fared overall. 


### Analysis and Challenges

**General updating**

After formatting the Kickstarter data and adding additional necessary information, like separating out the parent and subcategory, date created conversion, date ended conversion, and years, the next step is creating the pivot table and new data set based on Louise’s request. 

_*Based on Launch Date Analysis:*_

The pivot table filtered on the parent category, theater and then broken out by successful, failed, and canceled by month. The creation date which provides a timeframe breakout detailing the start a campaign by month. Then creating the line graph based on pivoted data revealed more easily that October didn’t have any data. I checked and October was zero and moved on to format the chart. The monthly breakout gave insight into the campaigns and displayed seasonality on which months are better, or worse, than others. 

_*Based on Goals Analysis:*_

Creating a new dataset breakout with new goal ranges to enable the data to be presented in a new way. After creating the initial column through a quick formula adding from the prior row, manually updating the first row and last row in the goal column. It was initially a little challenging because I was finding a faster way to change the ranges other than just typing each row out. I also found when completing the Countif formulas that there was no canceled data. I also froze the first column and did a find formula to pull the ranges. I added an if error formula to the percentages from the total projects by outcome. I also formatted the rest of the data set just for visuals. I then added a check figure at the bottom since I did do a formula to find the ranges instead of just a number for each row. 

After getting the details together, I created the line chart depicting by percentage of failed and successful, and canceled but the percentages were zero. This line chart, like the outcomes based on launch date, makes it much easier to really analyze the data for Louise. 


### Analysis of Outcomes

*Based on Launch Date:*

Based on the data, May and June are the most successful times to start a campaign for plays. Also, of theater campaigns, 839 out of the 1369 were successful which is 61% of the time. It’s about 20% more likely to be successful over a failed or canceled campaign. Failed campaigns were 31% of the total theater campaigns and canceled were 3%. 

*Based on Goals:*

The goals-based data gave a good indication of the various dollar buckets. Successful goals had an average of $4K per play and about $4.5K pledged while failed campaigns had an average of $10K per play but with only $500 pledged. The loftiest campaigns seemed to have less successful rate overall. With only two successful campaigns, $50K and greater, of the total 16 plays sampled. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

The obstacle I encountered was verifying the data captured correctly. I like to add checks or quick reviews to make sure the formulas work. For the most part putting the information together was listed well in the instructions. 


### Results

*Outcomes based on Launch Date:*

Based on the data, theater campaigns are successful more than 50% of the time. They are also the most successful when started in the months of May or June. The conclusions I drew from this data, is that theater campaigns which are made up of plays, spaces, and musicals, tend to be successful.  

*Outcomes based on Goals:*

Based on the goals data for plays, successful campaigns tend to have better results with goals lower than $6K. They have a success rate of over 75%. Campaigns that had goals greater than $50K failed 88% of the time. I would conclude, unless you have a large number of guaranteed backers, taking on plays greater than $50K, will not be a successful endeavor. I would also conclude, smaller plays seem to be the most lucrative in getting pledges matching or exceeding set goals, and consistency in business. 

#### **What are some limitations of this dataset?**

Maybe seeing if the backers were the same or different people? 
Checking out which location was more consistent than others?

**Other possible Table Options:**

Year over year trends based on goals

Year over trends based on launch date to find the specific dates 

Look at the location of where the plays took place to see if there is a correlation
